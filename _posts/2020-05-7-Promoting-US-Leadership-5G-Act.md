In the U.S. Government’s (USG) latest attempt to win the race to 5G and secure its leadership within the international standards community, two related pieces of legislation passed the House of Representatives (H.R.) in January 2020 and have made their way to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

H.R. 3763, [Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act of 2019](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr3763rfs/pdf/BILLS-116hr3763rfs.pdf), and H.R.4500 - [Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr4500/BILLS-116hr4500rfs.pdf), while similarly call for greater U.S. involvement in standards setting organizations (SSO), approach the end-goal slightly differently.  HR 3763 calls for the creation of an interagency group to brief Congress on (1) its strategy to promote U.S. leadership in the standards-setting bodies relevant to 5G technology; (2) its strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies and partners to share security-risk information related to 5G; (3) China's activities in standards-setting bodies for 5G technology, including the scope and scale of such activities; and (4) a strategy for engaging with private-sector stakeholders, academia, and federally funded research and development centers to propose and develop secure standards for 5G technology.

H.R. 4500, requires the Department of Commerce to assist trusted companies and relevant stakeholders with their participation in SSOs for telecommunications, wireless devices, and related equipment “to enhance the representation of the United States and promote United States leadership in standards-setting bodies that set standards for 5G networks and for future generations of wireless communications networks.”  The SSO explicitly noted are ISO, IEEE, 3GPP and any SSO accredited by ANSI or ATIS; despite that fact that ATIS is not an accreditation group.  

Given the similarities between the two bills, it is likely they will be consolidated at some point into a single bill and eventually signed into law.  The greater question as to how the USG intents to “ensure” their standards leadership has yet to be answered.
