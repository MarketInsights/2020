In January 2020, after nearly 18-months of development, NIST has released [Version 1.0](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nist.gov%2Fprivacy-framework%2Fprivacy-framework&data=02%7C01%7Ctimothy.jeffries%40futurewei.com%7C8665f56d7c25440f406908d79aae44a8%7C0fee8ff2a3b240189c753a1d5591fedc%7C1%7C0%7C637147945597405420&sdata=rlOa3UDi%2BOwRgiX8o1%2FNJZwoQ%2BAAi%2BVLrooT%2BcCJ4lU%3D&reserved=0) of the NIST Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving Privacy through Enterprise Risk Management.  

The Privacy Framework closely follows the structure of the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework), which it published several years ago. Like the Cybersecurity Framework, the Privacy Framework is composed of three parts: Core, Profiles, and Implementation Tiers.

As expressed by NIST, the Privacy Framework was developed to support organizations in (1) building customersâ€™ trust by supporting ethical decision-making in product and service design or deployment that optimizes beneficial uses of data; (2) fulfilling current compliance obligations, as well as future-proofing products and services to meet these obligations in a changing technological and policy environment; and (3) facilitating communication about privacy practices with individuals, business partners, assessors, and regulators.

Over the next year, NIST intends to engage with stakeholders to promote the use of the Framework including industry conferences and other outreach activities such as webinars and workshops.  Their first webinar was held on January 29, 2020 which can be seen [here](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2020/01/nist-privacy-framework-webinar-ready-set-adopt-version-10).
