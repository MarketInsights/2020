IBM and Oracle are now working to make their blockchains communicate with each other. The Interoperability program was [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/old-rivals-oracle-and-ibm-want-their-blockchains-to-talk-to-each-other) at the recent Hyperledger Global Forum in Phoenix, Ariz.

This would enable alignment and support of blockchain nodes running on both IBM and Oracle clouds, opening the door for connecting the consortia of firms clustered on the two platforms, and enabling a long-term goal for creating a simple user interface.

The business goal is an ecosystem ensuring support across multiple clouds and multiple vendors.

The business model is a global eco-system which can be operated and managed independent of formal supplier-oriented consortium.

Success has potential to expand customer confidence in global cross user deployments, providing incremental focus on blockchain adoption.
