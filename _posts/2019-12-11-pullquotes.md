Coronavirus Stunts IoT Insurgence
Contributor: Chuck Adams

ABI Research: Delayed insurgence of IoT will have to wait as a global pandemic crushes many of the industries that could benefit from increased connectivity. The rapid reversal is significant because the convergence of 5G, networks especially suited for IoT, and device proliferation was expected to bolster the technology before the pandemic hit.

COVID-19 has had an impact, and in the short term primarily related to manufacturing delays both in the semiconductor industry and the industries those devices serve, Markets such as automotive, industrial IoT, as well as 5G equipment will continue to suffer a little bit longer during the predicted recession even when manufacturing is 100%.

The eSIM (electronic, or embedded, SIM) market, for example, which is heavily dominated by the automotive industry, will likely suffer the greatest short-term impacts. Car manufacturing has declined considerably since the pandemic began. ABI Research remains confident in the long-term opportunities for â€œend-to-end chip-to-cloud security and the combination of cellular enablement paired with a secure chipset alongside a platform, which will form the basis from which security at the design phase will and can be implemented,

COVID-19 has forced most enterprise IoT engagements into mitigation mode. This has resulted in a temporary shift in terms of development roadmaps and budgets, but this will be a shorter term impact. Post pandemic IoT will play an important role in transforming the supply chain, per ABI Research. The evolving supply chain, the demand for IoT and artificial intelligence to enable cross supply chain asset visibility will become increasingly important. ABI Research anticipates supply chain process diversification to accelerate to limit business risk and the impact of future supply chain disruptions.  IoT technologies enable trust and reliability for engaging and integrating new partners and suppliers.

Contributor: Wael Diab

OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) released a report on the state of the global financial markets. The report highlights:
-	Turbulence in global financial markets: The economic impact of the global spread of COVID-19 has heightened market risk aversion in ways not seen since the global financial crisis
-	Corporate sector indebtedness and market vulnerabilities: In many countries, businesses have become highly indebted, and are now vulnerable to deteriorating economic and market conditions.
-	Policy considerations 
o	Expand central bank liquidity support 
o	Urgent fiscal support to viable businesses
o	Other fiscal support to small businesses and households
o	Market regulatory approaches
