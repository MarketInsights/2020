Despite expressed concerned from some U.S. telecom executives that they are likely to get “boxed in” with the U.S. Government’s (USG) actions to ban Chinese equipment deemed of threat to national security, representatives in the U.S. Congress is expected to restart talks shortly after the current impeachment trial to advance legislation on banning the future use of such equipment and are proposing funds to help operators remove existing equipment (“rip and replace”) from the U.S. networks.

Of particular interest, several pieces of legislations are currently in-play regarding 5G-related technologies and securing the national communication network.  Legislation of interest include the House-passed Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act ([HR-4998](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr4998/BILLS-116hr4998eh.pdf)), its companion legislation Senate Commerce-cleared U.S. 5G Leadership Act ([S-1625](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s1625/BILLS-116s1625is.pdf)), the Secure 5G and Beyond Act ([HR-2881](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr2881/BILLS-116hr2881pcs.pdf)), the Promot¬ing U.S. International Leadership in 5G Act ([HR-3763](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr3763/BILLS-116hr3763rfs.pdf)), and the Promoting U.S. Wireless Leadership Act ([HR-4500](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr4500/BILLS-116hr4500rfs.pdf)).  

HR-3763, of particular interest, illustrates USG’s desire to engage in international standards setting organizations, such as ITU, to ensure U.S. leadership in 5G and beyond.  Further the bill states that “[t]he State Department shall report to Congress on (1) its strategy to promote U.S. leadership in the standards-setting bodies relevant to 5G technology; (2) its strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies and partners to share security-risk information related to 5G; and (3) China's activities in standards-setting bodies for 5G technology, including the scope and scale of such activities.”  

The USG has long been under the impression that China has the ability to dominate the standards setting organizations and their processes to its sole advantage. HR-4500 direct NTIA to encourage U.S. companies and others to participate in international standards-setting bodies to the benefit of U.S. -- that is, in ways in which the U.S. has condemned China for its supposed involvement in standards.
