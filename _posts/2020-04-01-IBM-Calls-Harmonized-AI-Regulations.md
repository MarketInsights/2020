categories: Regulatory & Policy
---

In January 2020, IBM announced the launched of its newest initiative, called “Policy Lab,” to help advise and guide policymakers on critical public policy issues. The Lab’s aim is to develop and advocate for policies towards enabling new technologies while meeting present and future demands.  One of the Lab’s high priorities is to create rules that eliminate bias in AI systems and plan to work in concert with standards-setting bodies and governments to this end.

In a paper released by the Lab, [“Precision Regulation for Artificial Intelligence”](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IBM-AI-POV_FINAL2.pdf), IBM notes that “62% of Americans and 70% Europeans prefer a precision regulation approach for technology, with less than 10% in either region supporting broad regulation of tech. 85% of Europeans and 81% of Americans support consumer data protection in some form, and 70% of Europeans and 60% of Americans support AI regulation.”  The paper also proposes five (5) policy imperatives for companies to follow including the need to designate a lead AI ethics official and to be transparent in how they use AI.  

Other policy directions released by the Lab include “Precision Regulation and Facial Recognition,” “IBM and Climate Change: Early Action, Sustained Results, and Support for a Price on Carbon.”, and “A Precision Regulation Approach to Stopping Illegal Activities Online.”
