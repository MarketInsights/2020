In a recent [report](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/apple-google-working-technology-for-coronavirus-contact-tracing/) by the World Economic Forum, Apple Inc and Alphabet Incâ€™s Google will work together to create contact tracing technology that aims to slow the spread of the coronavirus by allowing users to opt into logging other phones they have been near.  This approach could accelerate usage of apps that aim to get potentially infected individuals into testing or quarantine more quickly and reliably, than existing systems in much of the world. Such tracing will play a vital role in managing the virus once lockdown orders end, health experts say.
