This [article](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/tmt/the-shape-of-the-recovery) is an economic analysis on what the shape of the recovery may look like from a financial perspective. While everything is pretty fluid, different scenarios are considered and contrast relative to the great depression is shown. Key takeaways include:
-	Shift from a rapid recovery to a moderated one. “expect GDP to contract by -3.2% in 2020 and not to return to its prior peak until 2022.”
-	Recovery anticipated to be faster than the great depression
-	Markets may be a leading indicator rebounding well ahead of the economy’s rebound
