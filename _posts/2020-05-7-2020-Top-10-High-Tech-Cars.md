The IEEE Spectrum has an [article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/2020-top-10-high-tech-cars?utm_source=carsthatthink&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=carsthatthink-04-08-20&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTXpKaE1XVTFOekZrTUdNMyIsInQiOiJ2enJOamdhT01ZVE9uWjM5TitSeG95UG1uTWNJVW9PQllUblVQMkd3OXFcL241T1RQNjhJS3RxTHRSalpxVlNGeUpaYys0K1o3WW51XC9EeTU3MFdvcnhYT21uTWlWQmwrZXJxdzlMaUpNbW1VMG9lakRtSjlVa3dsdFVcL2hoWjBxUCJ9) in the April 2020 print issue, “ 2020 Top 10 Tech Cars: This year, carmakers get serious about electric cars.”  It starts with the announcements that the car makers have made on their investment plans to develop electric vehicles (EVs), e.g., GM with US $20 billion over five years, Volkswagen Group with $66 billion over five years, and Ford with $11.5 billion. Then, based on cars that are already in showrooms or will be within the next few months, the author lists the following Top 10 Tech cars:

1)	Chevrolet Corvette Stingray C8: adopts a mid-engine design for the first time in its 67-year history.  Yes, an electrified version! Plus advanced ECUs, e.g., on-board Performance Data Recorder works like a real-life video game capturing point-of-view video and granular data on any drive, overlaying the video with telemetry readouts, and allowing drivers to analyze lap times and performance with Cosworth racing software.

2)	Polestar 1: hybrid tuned for performance, the first of several planned Polestars, a Volvo sub-brand that aims to expand the company’s electric reach around the globe.

3)	Hyundai Sonata: packed with luxury-level tech and alluring design at a mainstream price, e.g.,  the list of features includes Hyundai’s SmartSense package of forward-collision avoidance, automated emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, automatic high-beam assist, adaptive cruise control, and a drowsy-driver attention warning, and they’re all standard, even in the base model. Additional features include blind-spot monitor, smart park, etc.

4)	Porsche Taycan: is all-electric and outperforms Tesla Model S —for a price (sup to double the Tesla’s price); Fast off the mark and fast to charge, the Taycan inherits tech from Porsche’s LeMans-winning 919 Hybrid racers, including the 800-volt architecture.

5)	Audi RS Q8: a mild-hybrid version of the Q8. The RS Q8’s pulsing heart is a 4-liter, 441-kilowatt (591-horsepower) twin-turbo V8, augmented by a mild-hybrid system based on a 48-volt electrical architecture that sends up to 12 kW to charge a lithium-ion battery. A mammoth braking system, largely shared with the Lamborghini Urus, the Audi’s corporate cousin, includes insane 10-piston calipers up front. Audi’s digital Virtual Cockpit and MMI Touch center screens are smoothly integrated in a flat panel. The Audi Connect is an optional Android app that can be used by up to five people.

6)	Mini Cooper SE: offers all-electric sprightliness. This Mini squeezes 32.6 kilowatt-hours worth of batteries into a T-shaped pack below its floor without impinging on cargo space, adding only about 110 kg to a base gasoline Cooper. The Mini’s has less than one-third the capacity of the top Tesla Model S. That’s only enough for a mini-size range of 177 km (110 miles).

7)	Fiat 124 Spider: A drop-in electric-drive system gives new life to an old car—like the 1982 Spider; The California company, Electric GT,  has developed an ingenious plug-and-play “crate motor” that transplants an electric heart into most any vintage gasoline car. The system is designed to integrate exclusively with manual-transmission cars, including the Fiat’s charming wood-topped shifter and five forward gears.

8)	Toyota RAV4 Hybrid: A redesigned hybrid system optimizes fuel economy; Testing shows 41 miles per gallon (5.7 liters per 100 kilometers) in combined city and highway driving, 1 mpg better than the EPA rating. Toyota’s new Predictive Efficient Drive collects data on its driver’s habits and combines that with GPS route and traffic info to optimize both battery use and charging. Toyota’s Safety Sense gear includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking.

9)	Ford Escape Hybrid: an SUV with carlike efficiency; with its class-topping EPA rating of 5.7 liters per 100 kilometers (41 miles per gallon) in combined city and highway driving. Tech features include a nifty automated self-parking function, evasive-steering assist, and wireless smartphone charging. A head-up display available on the Titanium—Ford’s first ever in North America—projects speed, navigation info, driver-assist status, and other data onto the windshield. FordPass Connect, a smartphone app, lets owners use a smartphone to lock, unlock, start, or locate their vehicle, and a standard 4G LTE Wi-Fi system links up to 10 mobile devices.

10)	Aston Martin Vantage AMR: Best of Old and New, the AMR blends an actual manual transmission integrated into an adaptive power train and suspension; Take an Aston Martin Vantage, among the world’s most purely beautiful sports cars. Add a 375-kilowatt (503-horsepower) hand-assembled V8 from AMG, the performance arm of Mercedes-Benz, with its official 195-mph top speed.
