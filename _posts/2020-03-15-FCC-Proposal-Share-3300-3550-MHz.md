title: FCC Proposal to Share 3.3-3.55GHz
categories: Regulatory & Policy
---

The FCC has finally submitted its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ([NPRM](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-360941A1.pdf)), Facilitating Shared Use in the 3.1-3.55 GHz Band, for publication to the Federal Register whereby starting the clock for public comments.  Comments are due Feb. 21 with replies March 23.   

The NPRM proposes to clear the 3.3-3.55 GHz band by removing non-federal secondary radiolocation and amateur allocations and seeks comments on how best to relocate the incumbent users to either the 3.1-3.3 GHz band or other frequencies.  

In the NTIA study of the band, they have identified the 3.45-3.55 GHz band as the most promising portion for sharing in the near term and is continuing to perform feasibility studies in collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD) on sharing the band as well as the entire 3.1-3.55 GHz band with existing and future federal users.  The adjacent band, 3.55-3.7GHz, is the Citizen Band Radio Service (CBRS) band where services are shared utilizing a three-tier priority access approach. Comments from CBRS advocates (i.e., GOOGLE, Federated Wireless, Cisco, and Ruckus) in support of extending the CBRS band to include this band is expected.
