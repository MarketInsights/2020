Up until Congress shifted its focus on combating the coronavirus in mid-March, there was little to no shortage of aggression towards or discussions surrounding China and Huawei inside the DC beltway. Exemplifying the attacks on Huawei, on March 4, 2020, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing to assess “the security and integrity of the telecommunications supply chain” and to explore “the federal government’s role in mitigating risks to telecommunications equipment and services in the U.S. and abroad.”  

In identifying its list of experts on the topic, the U.S. Senate took the opportunity to make, yet another, political statement by excluding the leading global telecom suppler Huawei and instead limited its invite to Ericsson, Nokia and Intel along with the Competitive Carrier Association (CCA) and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  To no one’s surprise, the [hearing](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/3/5g-supply-chain-security-threats-and-solutions) quickly turned its focus to China and Huawei in particular, led by the representative from CSIS, James Lewis, who is a known antagonist.  

During the hearing, Lewis argued that the best way to minimize risk to the 5G supply chain was to “eliminate” Huawei, claiming a partial ban as the United Kingdom has done poses some risk.  CCA President’s Steve Barry noted however that eliminating Huawei as a competitor will affect the cost of equipment made available by other vendors stating that in 6 months to 18 months, new technologies will drive down the costs of equipment for carriers.

To the extent the U.S. Government’s (USG) aggression towards Huawei is dampened by recent events surrounding the coronavirus is yet to be seen.  However, should this hearing serve as any type of indictor, it remains apparent some within the federal circles remain laser-focused on China.
