As we have reported over the past few months, as expected and despite significant pushback, the FCC has approved its [Report & Oder (R&O)](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses) governing the 6GHz band in which the FCC will authorize the use of the entire 1200 MHz band (5925 â€“ 7125MHz) for secondary unlicensed (WiFi) services. 

The release of the R&O however, does not end the debate.  It is widely expected that the FCC will face either a submission for Reconsideration (RECON) or legal actions against the ruling prolonging the conclusion.  Stay tuned.
