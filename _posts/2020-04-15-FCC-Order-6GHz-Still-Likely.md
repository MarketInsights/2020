title: FCC Order on 6GHz Still Likely at April Meeting
categories: Regulatory & Policy

The U.S. regulatory decision regarding the reallocation and sharing of the 6 GHz band with Wi-Fi services appears to be still on track for the FCC Commissioners’ meeting in April 2020, by which ending the 18-month global debate in the U.S., on what should happen in the 6 GHz band.

At stake, on one side of the debate, are existing incumbents in the band, like AT&T who have licensed spectrum for broadcast services, which have gone a record claiming the introduction of unlicensed wireless services in the band will case adverse interference to their services.  On the other side, Wi-Fi advocates claim the 1200 mega-hertz of new spectrum (5925-7125 MHz) it seeks is critically important to maintain Wi-Fi’s growth and its related social and economic values.  And lastly, on the outside looking in, the licensed mobile carriers argue that they need at least some of the band for 5G services given the lack of mid-band spectrum for mobile services.  For the most part, the FCC’s position on 6 GHz has not changed throughout the debate and they seem determined to give the Wi-Fi community whatever it wants; both the 6GHz band and its adjacent ITS 5.9GHz band.  

CTIA, the wireless industry’s lobbying organization, remains committed however to pushing for some licensed use of part of the band.  In several of their submissions to the FCC, CTIA agrees the U.S. needs more channels for the next generation of Wi-Fi, but 1200 MHz seems extreme.  NCTA, not surprisingly, takes the opposite view and argues the entire 6 GHz band “is the future home for Wi-Fi, both today and into the future.”  For what its worth, Wi-Fi advocates believe they have already won the fight and are moving forward on developing and deploying Wi-Fi 6 for the 6 GHz band with work ongoing in IEEE 802.11 to develop the standards.
