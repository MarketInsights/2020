Although lost in the noise of other news, the U.S. White House recently released its latest national strategy entitled [“National Strategy to Secure 5G, March 2020”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/National-Strategy-5G-Final.pdf) which intends to expand on how the U.S. will secure 5G infrastructures domestically and abroad. Based on reviews from multiple expert, however, many have commented that the report is “thin” on details, lacks substance, and offers nothing new to the debate.  

As outlined in the report, the U.S. national strategy, as presented by the White House, is to “lead the development, deployment, and management of secure and reliable 5G communications infrastructure worldwide, arm-in-arm with our closest partners and allies.”  To this end, in additional to other federal actions, the report highlights the FCC’s plan to Facilitate America’s Superiority in 5G Technology (the 5G FAST Plan) and repeats the U.S. commitment “[to] participate in the development of international 5G security principles through frameworks, such as the Prague 5G Security Conference.”

Releasing the report now, despite the media noise, was meant to complement the [“Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act,”](https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ124/PLAW-116publ124.pdf) which Trump also recently signed into law. That law, often referred to the “rip and replace” law, in part establishes (1) a mechanism to prevent communications equipment or services that pose a national security risk from entering U.S. networks, and (2) a program to remove any such equipment or services currently used in U.S. networks.  More specifically, the bill prohibits the use of certain federal funds to obtain communications equipment or services from a company that poses a national security risk to U.S. communications networks (e.g., Huawei). And lastly, the FCC must publish and maintain a list of such equipment or services.

While indeed thin on specifics, the report does touch on various network-related aspects of interest including: (1) Managing the Supply Chain Risks in United States Government Infrastructure - Including 5G; (2) Addressing the Risk of ‘High-Risk’ Vendors in United States 5G Infrastructure; (3) Developing and Promoting Implementation of International 5G Security Principles; and (4) Promoting United States Leadership in International Standards Development and Adoption.
