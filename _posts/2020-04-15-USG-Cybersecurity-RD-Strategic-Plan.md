In December 2019, the U.S. National Science and Technology Council (“NSTC”) released its [“Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Federal-Cybersecurity-RD-Strategic-Plan-2019.pdf) providing a guide to the overall direction of federally funded R&D work in cybersecurity.  

As outlined in the plan, there are six (6) priority areas for R&D funding. Provided are the six areas and a brief description of their goals:

#### Artificial Intelligence:
Goal - Simulate different decision-support scenarios with respect to threat models, including attacker/defender strategies related to specific AI/ML implementations; Expand and explore new AI-based techniques for cybersecurity tasks beyond malware and intrusion detection; Develop models, definitions, and metrics of security and trust that can be used to evaluate AI cybersecurity systems and AI-based cybersecurity controls

#### Quantum Information Services:
Goal – Design “type-safe” quantum programming languages; explore new theoretical and experimental methods to probe quantum states, quantum processes, and their quantum properties; draft standards for quantum-resistant cryptography; understand how quantum technologies can be exploited for attacks on classical and/or quantum systems and understand security threats against quantum devices and their supply chain

#### Trustworthy Distributed Digital Infrastructure:
Goal - Develop standards to support seamless, end-to-end security across interconnected networks, trust domains, topologies, networking paradigms, and mobile devices and mobile network layers; develop end-to-end security and key management capabilities offering secure, highly resourced nodes to interoperate with resource-limited edge and IoT devices; develop technologies to sustain autonomous management of security across the communication infrastructure

#### Privacy:
Goal -- Develop research methods that can reliably and validly sample, measure, and represent people’s privacy desires, expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and interests; develop methods and technologies that can identify privacy violations and privacy harms; devise frameworks that integrate safety, security, and privacy requirements; foster techniques and models that can systematically assess and quantify privacy risks; develop models, techniques, and evaluation metrics for redress and recovery from privacy violations

#### Secure Hardware & Software:
Goal -- Develop novel processes, techniques, and mechanisms that protect against reverse-engineering efforts; develop mechanisms and tools that verify the security properties of hardware; develop secure debug and testing techniques; develop new software development methodologies that allow rapid revision and regression against security goals; develop secure update mechanisms that support the full range of product formats; develop cost- and threat-proportionate integrated root-of-trust alternatives for various hardware devices, ranging from low-cost IoT devices and networked sensor devices to server computers

#### Education & Workforce Development:
Goal -- Accelerate adoption of a modern taxonomy of the cybersecurity workforce;  conduct research on effective models to educate individuals of different backgrounds and ages; research innovative ways to develop talent in all sectors of society to build the cybersecurity workforce; support experiential learning, such as apprenticeships, internships, job-shadows, and other employer-educator partnerships; and focus not only on developing expertise but also on research on how the education and training ecosystem can develop interdisciplinary approaches that support innovation
