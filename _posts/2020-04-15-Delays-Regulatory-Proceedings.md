As the coronavirus continues to take its toll on the industry as a whole, regulatory agencies are trying their best to maintain some level and normalcy and advance important pending proceedings.  In recent announcements, however, there have been setbacks.  In recent public releases, the FCC has announced the delay of two spectrum auctions (Auction 105 and 106), has postponed their “Forum on 5G Virtualized Radio Access Networks”, have extended the filing deadlines for numerous proceedings including net neutrality, and granted special licenses to most wireless carriers to extend/expand coverage during the outbreak.  On the upside, many of the longer-term events and schedule remain intact, such as the C-Band auction which is still set for December 2020.
