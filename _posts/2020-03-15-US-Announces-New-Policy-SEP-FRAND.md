The Department of Justice (DOJ), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), recently issued a [joint statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office-and-national-institute-standards) on remedies for Standard-Essential Patents (“SEP”) and fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.  As noted in the press release:

“The Statement clarifies that a patent owner’s promise to license a patent on F/RAND terms is not a bar to obtaining any particular remedy, including injunctive relief.  The agencies make clear that no “special set of legal rules” apply to SEPs, and the courts, the U.S. International Trade Commission, and other decision makers are able to assess appropriate remedies based on current law and relevant facts.  According to the Statement, “The particular F/RAND commitment made by a patent owner, the [standard development organization’s] intellectual property policies, and the individual circumstances of licensing negotiations between patent owners and implementers all may be relevant in determining remedies for infringing a standards-essential patent, depending on the circumstances of each case.”
