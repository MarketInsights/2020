While the full extent of COVID-19’s impact on the industry has yet to be fully understood or realized, it will most certainly have an effect.  The only remaining question is to what level.

As the COVID-19 siege continues, and industry takes steps necessary to combat its effect, questions are beginning to surface, and opinions are starting to flow.  

In an article by Business Insider, ["The Coronavirus Pandemic Could Impact 5G Deployment Timelines For Network Operators"](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-could-delay-next-set-of-5g-standards-2020-3), the author notes that the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has delayed the upcoming release of new 5G standards by three months due to the coronavirus.  And that, any changes to their scheduled releases will likely cause cascading delays to product development and consumer uptake.

In addition, three groups in the 5G ecosystem that could be most affected by the delays include:
•	Networking equipment-makers
•	Network operators
•	5G device-makers working on industrial IoT devices

The connectivity ecosystem is highly interrelated, which means even a minor delay somewhere can quickly snowball and have an exaggerated impact.

Looking ahead, the effects of a delayed release will likely be compounded further by the effects of the pandemic — tech companies are already struggling with the fallout from damaged supply lines and store closures left in the virus's wake.
