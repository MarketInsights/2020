The recent stay-at-home orders have served to focus consumers on their residential access solution.  

It has been observed that the problem with optical access is that it has excessive capacity.  This arises from fact that replacing copper access with fiber produces an immediate quantum leap in capacity, while the bandwidth usage behavior of the customer generally changes gradually.  Many operators around the world have taken a forward looking approach and have upgraded their networks to fiber; however, they have found that they cannot charge a significantly higher premium for this vastly superior network, simply because their customers don’t properly value the resource.  

We have long known that many of the pressing problems of society today could be reduced if we really used communications effectively to every home.  Energy usage and its concomitant resource exhaustion and environmental pollution could be greatly reduced if people didn’t have to commute to work every day.  It would also reduce traffic congestion on the road, and in the longer term it would allow the population to be more evenly distributed over the country, reducing overcrowding and improving quality of life.  In terms of resources, fewer office buildings and automobiles will be needed.  Despite all these obvious advantages, we have not seen a large-scale adoption of the work-from-home model.  This, again, has to do with the slow change of people’s behavior and value system.    

This is why the Covid19 pandemic could be a game changer for networking.  The entire society is now forced to adopt the new model of remote working.  The use of video teleconferencing is now a standard daily occurrence, and one can expect this to begin a progression to even better forms of work environment simulation (virtual reality, continuous telepresence, and so on).  By the same token, the fundamental attraction of wireless communication (mobility) will be of reduced importance.  We shouldn’t expect people to drop their smart-phones, but we should see a larger proportion of smartphone traffic being carried over WiFi (and then fixed access) rather than cellular networks.

Moreover, the pandemic is providing the world with an example of a low emissions world.  Levels of air pollution (NOx) are vastly lower than they were just a couple of months ago.  The travel infrastructure is less heavily loaded, and this can reduce both repair and construction costs.  These positive effects may be noticed by governments around the world and give a live example of what is possible if needless commuting and travel are reduced.  

Of course, we hope that the virus will soon run its course, and the shelter-in-place orders will be lifted.  However, even then it can be expected that a fraction of our workforce will continue to work from home, at least to a larger extent than they do today.  And when they do, they will develop a new-found perception of value from fixed broadband services.  This will make the market more receptive to value-add service offerings, and thus the network should become more profitable.  This should in turn make the entire ecosystem healthier.   So, in summary, the current pandemic may cause temporary economic problems, but in the long run we expect that it will benefit the telecom industry, and in particular fixed access.
