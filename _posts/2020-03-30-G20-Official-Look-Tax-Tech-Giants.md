In a recent [report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-tax/lets-come-together-to-tax-tech-giants-say-g20-officials-eyeing-100-billion-boost-idUSKCN20G0DD) by Reuters, “Let's come together to tax tech giants, say G20 officials eyeing $100 billion boost,” the news agency reported that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") is developing global rules aimed towards requiring digital companies to pay tax wherever they do business, rather than where they are registered subsidiaries. The OECD says this could boost national tax revenues by a total of $100 billion a year.

In a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in February 2020 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the call for unity appeared directed mainly at the United States, home to the global digital giants.

The U.S. is purportedly attempting to head off any changes to the rules until after its presidential election in November, while others are seeking an agreement to set a minimum effective level at which such companies would be taxed by the start of July with final endorsement by the G20 by the end of the year.
