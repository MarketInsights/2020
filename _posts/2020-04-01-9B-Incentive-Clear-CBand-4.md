At the latest FCC Open Commission Meeting on February 28th, the FCC Commissions approved two critical proceedings related to the clearing of the C-Band and its associated auction.

In the FCC Public Notice, [Auction of Flexible-Use Service Licenses in the 3.7–3.98 GHZ Band for Next-Generation Wireless Services](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-362359A1.pdf), the FCC released details associated with the clearing of the C-Band and seeks comment on the procedures to be used for auctioning the licenses in the band (Auction 107); which is to commence on December 8, 2020.

To clear the band and make it ready for (flexible) commercial use, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is proposing a $9.7 billion incentive to the C-Band satellite incumbents to vacate the band.  According to the C-band Draft Order, [Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-362358A1.pdf), Intelsat would be eligible for up to $4.85 billion if relocated by the 2021 and 2023 clearing deadlines. SES would be eligible for $4 billion, Eutelsat for $467 million, Telesat for $374 million and Star One for $13.6 million.

The Order would also (1) transition 280 megahertz, plus a 20-megahertz guard band, from incumbent use to flexible-use by September 30, 2025 through a Commission-led public auction; (2) Require incumbent FS licensees to relocate their point-to-point links to other bands, by September 30, 2023; and (3) provide both incumbent FSS and FS licensees with reimbursement of reasonable relocation costs paid by flexible-use licensees as a condition on their license.

Post-transition of incumbents, the FCC is proposing to create two categories of generic blocks in each Partial Economic Area (PEA); namely, Category A which would consist of blocks in the lower 100 megahertz (3.7–3.8 GHz), and Category BC which would consist of blocks in the remaining 180 megahertz (3.8–3.98 GHz).

The FCC plan appears to have a lot of industry support and is expected to be approved.
